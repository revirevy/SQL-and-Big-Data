### Mannino 3.4, 4 and Visc 4-6

### Working with data types

`CAST` to change data type, CAST(RetailPrice AS CHARACTER(8))  
`CONCATENATE` with `||`  

Math Expressions  
`ABS`  
`MOD` remainder after division   
`FLOOR` largest int less or equal to number

### SELECT and PROJECT

`SELECT` Made up of a combo of keywords (ie clauses), filters by rows  
Includes `from`, `where`, `group by`, `having`
```
SELECT DISTINCT col1, col2 
FROM table 
ORDER BY col DESC
```

`PROJECT` filters by columns

### Joining

`PRODUCT` returns combo of tables  
`JOIN` returns combo of tables, requires matching condition

Natural joins  
1. Combines rows (product operation)  
2. Removes rows that dont satisfy (restrict operation)  
3. Remove one of the join columns (project operation)

`Outer join` keeps matching + nonmatching rows  
`Full outer join` keeps matching + nonmatching from both
`One sided outer` keeps matching + nonmatching from one

These 3 must be Union compatibility = both tables must have same number of cols and with matching data types  
`Union` all rows in either table  
`intersection` all rows in common  
`difference` all rows unique to tab1  


`Divide`  finds values of one col that are associated with every value in another col  
`Summarize` organize table on specific groupong cols


### Inexact matching

`LIKE '*IS4*` for strings
`BETWEEN '1-Jan-1999' AND '31-Dec-2000'` for numbers and dates
